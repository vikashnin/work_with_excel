# **Kickstarter Challenge**
## Overview of Project
Get familiar with the Kickstarter data file and anaylze the different campaigns fundriser goals between plays and theater. By creating a visual dataset to give Louise a detailed look at the outcomes of launch dates and funding goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges 

Present a visual representation, that will help Louise with her decision. By analyzing the data on pledges, goals, outcomes and getting a visual graph on what months campaigns are more sucessful.

Due to us having a step by step it really guided me through on how to navigate the data sheet. One major challenge I encountered was using Excel on my Mac, I realized that Mac us not really user friendly for Excel. However, I was able to overcome most of my problems in the beginning half of the challenge. By simply searching what I was looking for in my Excel. Towards the end my formula just wasn't working on my Mac and the previous data points I entered for example, mean median, IQR etc... was also showing as an error. Even though all of my information was correct. I whiched to a Pc to complete the rest of the challenge.

##Results

###What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
My first conclusion would be that Louise's play is more likely to be successful if it was released toward the begining of the year, April, May, or June are ideal. My second conclusion was the theater outcomes for launchs towards the end of the year was not great as it starts to plummet after June and goes down even further in Novemenber and December.

###What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
