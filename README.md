## Analysis and Challenges 



Due to us having a step by step it really guided me through on how to navigate the data sheet. One major challenge I encountered was using Excel on my Mac, I realized that Mac us not really user friendly for Excel. However, I was able to overcome most of my problems in the beginning half of the challenge. By simply searching what I was looking for in my Excel. Towards the end my formula just wasn't working on my Mac and the previous data points I entered for example, mean median, IQR etc... was also showing as an error. Even though all of my information was correct. I whiched to a Pc to complete the rest of the challenge.
